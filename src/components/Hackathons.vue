                On of my favorite hobbies is to compete in hackathons. I've done my best to improve my overall
                coding skills by becoming involved with them. Through hackathons, I have discovered and built a solid
                community of people I respect and enjoy working with. I have attended <b>{{hackathons.length}}</b> hackathons so far!
