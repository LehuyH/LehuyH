                One of my favorite hobbies is competing in hackathons. By getting involved with them, I have been able
                to improve my overall coding skills. In addition, I discovered and built a strong community of people I
                respect and enjoy working with through hackathons. So far, I've participated in over
                <b>{{hackathons.length}}+</b> hackathons so far!
